    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The culmination of this term's effort is showcased in this notebook, demonstrating the development of knowledge and skills acquired throughout the BEMM461 project. The primary focus lies in presenting a key visualization that encapsulates the project's essence. The notebook delves into the project's background, offering insights into the business context and expounding on the identified decision-making process. Moreover, it includes a thorough review and critique of the chosen analytics methods, followed by an evaluation of the selected tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure transparency, a link to the utilized datasets is provided, facilitating access to the data for further exploration. The notebook showcases the Python code developed for visualizing the data, allowing others to grasp the methodologies employed. Additionally, a reflective blog is furnished, elucidating the project's journey, highlighting encountered challenges, and imparting valuable lessons gleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion offers a comprehensive summary of the entire notebook, encapsulating the key findings and outcomes. Throughout the document, authoritative references are thoughtfully provided and diligently cited to support the presented work.\n",

    "## 2. Project Dashboard\n",
    "You are to provide an interactive, web based dashboard built using the Dash python framework that uses [Dash.plotly.com](http://dash.plotly.com).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your dashboard should provide the key visualisations of the project.  Use the dashboard to present the key visualisations that a manager or a consultant would need to make decisions.  Place the python code to create the dashboard in the cell of this notebook.  See below for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dashboards need to aggregate and summarise appropriately.  Consider how human memory and perception play a part in interpreting data.  Dashboards focus on iconic and short-term memory.  The goals of dashboard design are as follows:\n",
    "- display using the most effective media possible so that it can easily be perceived.  This is where a web based dashboard is best suited.  \n",
    "- Organise the information as concisely as possible so that short-term memory can optimally group and analyse quickly and accurately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Effective dashboards contain layers of information that the audience can delve into deeper.  Structure your information to account for these layers.  Use the Monitor, Analyse, Drill to detail approach as determined by Wayn Eckerson.\n",
    "Monitor - a high level trend, issue or anomaly.\n",
    "Analyse - show more detail but still a summary.  Tailored to your audience.\n",
    "Detail - includes more details but still relevant to the audience."
